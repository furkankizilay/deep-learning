# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions from data. These networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes, or neurons, which process and transform data as it passes through them. "Deep" refers to the multiple layers, allowing the network to automatically learn complex patterns and features from raw data. It has been particularly successful in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and other tasks that require sophisticated pattern recognition and understanding.
