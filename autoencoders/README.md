# Autoencoders

Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning. They are designed to encode and decode data, essentially learning a compressed representation of input data in an unsupervised manner.

The network is divided into two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes input data and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation, often called a "code" or "latent space." The decoder then takes this compressed representation and tries to reconstruct the original input data.

The goal of an autoencoder is to minimize the difference between the input data and the reconstructed output. By doing so, the network learns to capture important features and patterns in the data during the compression process. Autoencoders have various applications, such as dimensionality reduction, data denoising, and feature learning, and they can also be used for generating new data similar to the input data.
